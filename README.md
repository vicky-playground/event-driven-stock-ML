# ⚡ Event-Driven Stock Prediction

The goal of this project is to let me learn **Event-Driven Architecture**, **CQRS**, **Event Sourcing**, and **Apache Kafka** using a real-time stock prediction example with LSTM models. 

⚠️Please note the prediction is not reliable at all as the LSTM model does not account for critical stock market factors such as company fundamentals, macroeconomic indicators, or market sentiment.

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **CQRS**: Separate models for commands (writes) and queries (reads)
- **Event Sourcing**: All actions recorded as immutable events
- **Kafka**: Event broker to decouple producers and consumers
- **ML Pipeline**: LSTM model with technical indicators
- **Dashboard**: Web interface to send commands and visualize results

## 🧱 Architecture
User → HTTP API → Command → Kafka Events → Async ML → Predictions → Read Model →
